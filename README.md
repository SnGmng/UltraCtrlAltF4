#UltraCtrlAltF4
The CTRL-ALT-F4 Hotkey FORCES Applications to close (unlike standard ALT-F4). The Foreground Application will be killed INSTANTLY when you press CTRL-ALT-F4

UltraCtrlAltF4 kills the foreground program INSTANTLY when you press Ctrl+Alt+F4. This is different from when you press Alt+F4. When you press Alt+F4, the program can refuse to quit. Windows only asks the program to quit, and lets it decide for itself what to do.
